After escaping from her second imprisonment by her stalker, she began to train in martial arts in her spare time.  As compensation for the abductions, Lia was given all of her stalker's possessions.  They sold off the mansion and most of the other things, but Reika kept most of the restraints and fetish gear for herself.  The uniform she debuted afterwards with the ballet heels and mittens she took from her captor has become a huge hit with the patrons of the cafe where she works. So popular that Reika, her manager and girlfriend, has made it her required daily wear.</p><p>Several months after she escaped, Reika finally proposed to Lia after work one night.  Kneeling in front of her lover, she wasn't prepared to take no for an answer as she snapped the halves of the engagement ring closed around Lia's finger.  "I'm afraid you have to marry me now, because the ring won't come off!"  Not that Lia would have declined, as she was equally in love at that point.</p><p>Six months after the proposal, the two girls were married at a ceremony outside the cafe.  Reika was beautiful, wearing a traditional white wedding dress.  Lia was also beautiful, but her dress was anything but traditional.  The dress Lia wore to her wedding was the one that her stalker had made and attempted to put her in the first time she was abducted.  It was amazingly beautiful, with a tiny waist, voluminous skirts, and lace and sparkles adorning it.</p><p>It was also the most oppressively restraining thing she had ever worn, with her arms forced into a reverse prayer, and then laced and locked inside the bodice of the dress itself.  She had become quite adept at walking on ballet heels by then, so the boots were no problem for her.  What was a problem was the numerous vibrators inside the dress that Reika constantly turned up and down throughout the ceremony.  It even included a mask and neck corset that covered her mouth and nose, completely filling her mouth and blocking her from making any noises.</p><p>Reika and Lia traded vows and mmphs with each other, and then they traded collars instead of rings. Reika's was more of a tight necklace than a collar with a diamond heart hanging down, while Lia's was a more secure leather collar with a buckle and a heart shaped lock.</p><p>The two lovebirds began to play bondage games more and more often after the marriage, and before long, Lia was sleeping in some sort of restraint every night.  Using the vast amount of money they made from selling off the stalker's possessions, Reika has built up an impressive collection of fetish clothing and other restraints.  Looking for even more things to play with, she started commissioning new articles based on ideas she had, and even started to learn how to make various implements themselves.</p><p>One day about three months after the marriage, Reika called Lia into her office after work.  Lia came in smiling mischievously as she held her mittened hands behind her.</p><p>"What do you need? Did you get something new?"  Lia had a smirk on her face-- she knew that whenever she was called like this it meant Reika had something new for her.  She was fidgetting back and forth every few seconds, paying extra attention to keeping her skirt down and flat with her hands.</p><p>"Oh, looking cute as always!  How is that belt treating you?"  Reika never missed the chance to complement her wife.  She reached into her pocket and manipulated a small remote, causing Lia to gasp loudly and reach into her crotch.  Reika would frequently make Lia work while locked into a vibrating chastity belt.  "Let's play a game~ I got a new toy I want you to try to escape from!"</p><p>"Think you have something good this time? I bet I can get out~  This time I'll even keep on the stuff I'm wearing!"  Lia was pretty confident in her escaping abilities after escaping from her stalker twice.  With the training she had been doing, she could even escape from Reika's gear most of the time, as long as it wasn't too overwhelming.</p><p>"Hooou, getting a little arrogant are we?"  Reika gives Lia a quick kiss on the lips.  "Without even knowing what it is, you're going to challenge it with mittens, heels and a belt?  I can't say I don't like the idea."  It became clear over time that Lia was just as kinky as Reika was, even if she didn't show it all the time. "Now, ready?"</p><p>Reika brought out an armbinder with additional straps attached.  It was one of her favorite pieces of gear, and it was also one that Lia had never been able to escape or loosen, even a single time.  Turning Lia around, she locked the cuffs on her elbows and wrists together.  Then she slid the armbinder up and laced it shut, forcing her elbows together.  Zipping over the laces, she buckled the straps around Lia's arms and torso.  The attached straps held the armbinder securely against her body, and were the main reason the armbinder is so inescapable.  Slipping a lock into each buckle, she slowly pushed Lia to her knees.</p><p>"How is it so far? Still confident?"  Lia put up a brave front and nods, eager to see the new toy.  Reika locked Lia's ankles to her thighs with a pair of straps, frogtying her securely.  Picking her up, she placed her face down on a table.  Using more straps, she pulled her legs and armbinder together, forcing her back to arch as she tightens the hogtie.  When she stops, Lia's legs and shoulders are pulled a fair distance off of the table, and her face is showing signs of distress.</p><p>Lia knew at this point the whole escape plot was just a joke by Reika, and she had no intention of letting her even a chance at escape.  This hogtie was as tight as she had ever been bound, and she had no chance to escape it, or even move much of anything.</p><p>"Open~"  She pulled firmly back on Lia's hair and pushed her favorite ballgag into Lia's mouth.  The rubber ball attached was significantly larger than normal ballgags, and as such after a short period of time, her jaw gets quite painful.  Reika quickly buckled and locked the gag behind Lia's head, under her chin, and over her forehead.  Another small strap threaded through the ring at the top and is pulled back to the armbinder, forcing her neck back severely.  A blindfold was slid under the straps and locked tightly over her eyes.</p><p>"Now, as I've got a captive audience here, let me explain what I've got here."  Lia squirmed weakly, she had absolutely no way to free herself at this point and could only listen.  "This is something I bought online.  It's a brand new virtual reality game system.  With it you can experience an entirely new world!  I also bought a game for it, named 'Assault on the Dark Castle'.  The objective is to depose the dark leader of a castle who is abusing the citizens of the kingdom.  Sounds like fun, right?  The best part is that it has an option so that instead of taking injuries or other damage, the enemies will attempt to tie you up in various ways.  I knew I had to have it as soon as I heard about it.</p><p>"Let's get you started.  I can't wait to watch your struggles!"  Lia felt a pair of goggles placed over her head, and then the sounds of electronics starting up.  Seconds later, she felt her whole body get yanked through a bright light, and before she knews it, she was standing in some strange wireframe room. A mechanical voice speaks up suddenly, "Welcome to 'Assault on the Dark Castle'. Please select your desired settings."</p><p>Looking around, Lia suddenly noticed she is no longer bound.  She was standing, completely free, and also naked.  "Ah..."  It's amazingly real, and she can't tell this world apart from reality.  A menu box appeared, asking for her to select options.</p><p>Reika's voice suddenly played out in the room she is standing in.  "I'll be picking these options for you, he he..."  The first menu box asked her to select between 'Normal Mode' and 'Bondage Mode'.  The cursor moved to 'Bondage Mode' on its own and selected it.</p><p>The next menu displays a number of difficulties. 'Easy, Normal, Hard, Extreme'.  Lia reached out her hand to press 'Easy' but the cursor moves before she can reach it and selects 'Hard'.  "Uh uh, I'm picking the options here~"  Reika's voice taunted her again as it continued to select options.</p><p>The third menu set the amount of restraints that will be placed on the player when she fails at a challenge.  Reika selects 'Normal' out of the list, remarking, "As much as I want to pick 'Strict Bindings', I also want you to be able to actually clear this someday."</p><p>The final menu determined the severity and type of the punishment events, from 'None' to 'Severe' and with options ranging all sorts of fetishes, from 'Sex' to 'Rape' to 'Bondage', 'Group Encounters', 'Petplay' and a host of other subjects.  Lia shivered thinking of the possibilities, when Reika speaks up again.  "Don't worry, I know what kind of things you like" she said with a chuckle, before selecting 'Bondage' and 'Humiliation' with an 'Average' severity.</p><p>The menus disappeared, with only a 'Start Game' button appearing, blinking slowly.  "Well, I'll be watching from here, my dear!  Have fun~"  The button was pressed by the cursor, and Lia felt herself pulled through the world again as it goes white all around her.  When the world stops rushing by, she found herself on the ground in the middle of a road in a medieval era town.  Towering over the city is a large castle on a hill.  Nearby, she saw a wanted poster naming the 'Princess' of the castle to be the nemesis of the villagers.  Gripping the paper, Lia started to work on the quest.  The first thing to do is figure out how she would get inside the castle.</p>
